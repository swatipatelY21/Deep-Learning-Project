# Deep-Learning-Project
This project aims to predict mortality using ANN model. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encoding categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for feeding into an ANN model The trained model achieves an accuracy of 87% on the test dataset.
